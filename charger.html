<p><font color="white">The Dodge Charger is my favorite out of all of the cars.</p>

<p><font color="white">The Charger seats five people and has great luscious leg room for the people in the back seats.</p>

<p><font color="white"><img src="seats.jpg" height="200"</p>

<p><font color="white">The Charger is a secan but still manages to look great and gets looks by strangers, due to it not being a very common car.</p>

<p><font color="white">The Charger is great for driving friends and family around or to home due to its amazing seat room.</p>

<p><font color="white">The Charger's body is really nice and smooth and the tail lights also look really amazing.</p>

<p><font color="white"><img src="charger.jpg" height="150"</p>


<p><font color="white">The Charger is the one that I'm most interested because it seats manny and sill looks amazing.</p>

<p><font color="white">The other two still do look amazing but they dont have crowded leg room in the back, and for me thats a huge problem.</p>

<p><font color="white">They all range in prices from the Mustang at 20-30 grand making it the most expensive and the other two at 10-15 grand.</p>

<p><font color="white">That's the beauty of the Charger its cheaper and seats five with luscious leg room.</p>

<p><font color="white">For me the best car out of all three is the Dodge Charger.</p>
