<p><font color="white">My hobby</p>

<p><font color="white">In my spare time I love to look at fast muscle cars such as Mustangs, Dodge Challengers and Chargers.</p>

<p><font color="white">The Mustangs look amazing and tough but they practically only seat two the other two seats in the back are really small and crowded.</p>

<p><font color="white">The Dodge Challenger is a pretty cool looking car and has the same body type as it did in when they first came out but just like the Mustang it has really bad leg space for the back but it does seat five.</p>

<p><font color="white">The Dodge Charger is an amazing car that seats five and looks just as tough.</p>

<p><font color="white">The Charger is the one that I'm most interested because it seats manny and sill looks amazing.</p>

<p><font color="white">The other two still do look amazing but they dont have crowded leg room in the back, and for me thats a huge problem.</p>

<p><font color="white">They all range in prices from the Mustang at 20-30 grand making it the most expensive and the other two at 10-15 grand at best.</p>

<p><font color="white">That's the beauty of the Charger its cheaper and seats five with luscious leg room.</p>

<p><font color="white">For me the best car out of all three is the Dodge Charger.</p>
